Welcome to the website of the 7th International Workshop on Asynchronous Programming Models (formerly ABS Workshop), which will be held on the 1st – 3rd October in Porto, Portugal, hosted by the University of Porto. Information about prior iterations can be found [here](https://abs-models.org/publications/).


## Description
{: .secondH}

The APM Workshop is a venue for the discussion of asynchronous programming patterns, languages and model, ranging from theoretical results, over applications and implementations to opinion and overview contributions. To create a welcoming atmosphere for the community, there are no proceedings – instead we welcome presentations on published, on-going or envisioned work. We especially encourage the participation of junior researchers and presentations that can be the basis for discussions on the future of the field.

The APM workshop stands in the tradition of the ABS workshop, whose last iteration took place in Turin, Italy, but is not specific to any language or paradigm.


## Venue
{: .secondH}

The workshop will be held at the University of Porto, located at the centre of the beautiful city of Porto. More concrete details will be provided later.
