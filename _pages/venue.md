Porto is a fascinating and vibrant city that has so much to offer as a holiday or city break destination. The city boasts an extensive history, unique tourist attractions, delicious cuisines and buzzing nightlife. Porto has a delightful historic centre and is famed for its Port wine, but it is also a young and energetic city, with social nightlife, liberal attitudes and a flourishing artisan scene. Take a look at [this page](https://porto-north-portugal.com/) for a quick guide of the city. The workshop is expected to take place at the __Department of Computer Science of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto__ and lunches will likely be served at a close by restaurant [__Maria Dentada__](https://mariadentada.pt/).
